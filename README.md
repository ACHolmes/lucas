# Interview project

## Installation & Setup

To be able to work on this project, you will need:

* Python3 installed and reasonably up to date (python 3.11 is latest stable build, but 3.10 or higher should be fine)

* Flask installed (`pip install flask`). sqlite3 is in Python's standard library.

## Running the project

From the top level folder, run `flask run`. You will be given a local address (e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:5000`) where you can view your webpage. You may want to run in `debug` mode so that saving your files will cause a live reload so that you don't have to re-run your project repeatedly, and one way to do this is using `flask run --debug`.

## Instructions

See `TASKS.md`.
